<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These Mexican fritters are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <p>1 cup water</p>
    <p>2½ tablespoons white sugar</p>
    <p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
   <p>1 cup all-purpose flour</p> 
   <p>2 quarts oil for frying</p> 
   <p>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</p> 
   <p> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<p><li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Stir in flour until mixture forms a ball.</li></p>
<p><li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pipe 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil using a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Do not overcrowd the oil. Fry until golden; drain on paper towels.</li></p>
<p><li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li></p>
</ol>
